Quick project for a rainy night to clear out my head after a day of using it.

What does this do?
It is a simple console app that takes a set of strings and outputs the commonalities of them all, starting from left to right. For example, "App", "Ap", and "Apple" would result in "Ap".

Why?
It was an interview question I was asked to pseudocode. I described what I would do to solve it quick, but I like solving problems so I put it in code quick, and here it lives.
